make the dancers clickable
  onclick
    1 - grab their top and apply to all the dancers in the global array
    
    2 - calculate the padding using the formula:
      ( doc.width / dancerArray.length - dancer.width ) / 2
      set that padding on the .css of every dancer's padding value
    
    2b - also, consider the left value (maybe use grid / wrapper)


think about sorting by types

// select all elements from the dom that match a class

 // store them in an iterable form
 
 //update their values
 
 //exercise suggests using the dancer array
 
 
 //make all dancers same class(dancer)
 //edit the dancer.css.top
  //automatically changes display of all nodes of that class
  //if that class is the last class in the css order (overwrites previous properties)
